# Created by Mauricio Salguero as part of Software Design With Python assigments.

You will find 5 python files in src folder, in each one you will find the following:

- main.py: four functions each one with 5 decorators above (the decorators are commented until you decide to use them).
- task1: Answer to question 1 called decorator_1
- task2: Answer to question 2 called decorator_2
- task3: Answer to question 3 with the implementations done in class and function decorator named decorator_3 and decorator3 respectively, so you can use whichever you want.
- taske 4: Answer to question 4, to use implementation of task 3 (extension) and task 4 use above the functions FIRST decorator3 AND SECOND decorator_4 (both decorators at the same time) to get full implementation.


Tabulate library was used to create a table so you need to download it for task 3.
